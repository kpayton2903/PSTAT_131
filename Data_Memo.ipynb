    "Before I answer any of the required questions, I will first import my data I have decided on so far. Everything comes from Kaggle at the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/open-source-sports/baseball-databank?resource=download. So far I have decided on using the Master.csv, Salaries.csv, and Batting.csv files which all have data from 1871 through 2015, but I will only be working with data from year 2000 to 2015. The Master.csv file contains personal information of all the players in the dataset, but I will only be using this to gather the names of players to make importing any future data easier since currently my datasets rely on player IDs. The Salaries.csv file contains team and league information, as well as the salary players have for any given year. Finally, my Batting.csv file contains various batting statistics for players."

As you can see from the output above we are then left with 18846 rows and 2 columns, with the rows each representing players. We are left with so many because we currently still have values from every player that has played since 1871 through 2015, but all those prior to 2000 will be removed once we merge with our salaries dataset. \n",

This file does not contain information on if a player was traded during the year, because their salary stays the same. This is an issue I might have later when dealing with the batting information, because there might be multiple rows for the same player during a given year.\n",

This is not the finished product as I still have to deal with the playerID issues and remove some stats that don't contain any information, but this is the general idea of what I will have. I should have around 13000 observations that I can split between my testing and training data, and around 15-20 predictors depending on if I can find more stats to add and what I deem as not necessary. I will primarily be working with floating point numbers and integers, but there will potentially be some categorical data such as team names and leagues. Currently, I see no missing data, but if there is some that I discover I will either simply remove those observations because I already have much more that I can work with or I will do some research to fill in the gaps if it isn't too time consuming."

    "I am interested in predicting the salary of a mlb player based on the variables I outlined above, mostly including batting stats. As a baseball fan, I find it crazy seeing how much some players make each year, so figuring out what statistics are typically the most important in determining a player's salary seemed interesting. The salary is simply just an integer amount showing how much a specified mlb player makes in a given year in US dollars. This questions will be best answered with regression since the response variable is numerical. I believe the most important variables will the specific team, year, runs, home runs, and hits. The goal of my model is predictive so that we can precit what a player with any stats would potentially make for a given year."
